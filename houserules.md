# Preface

All of these house rules are at the DM's discretion and may be adjusted to fit the situation.

# Healing Potions

The amount of "time" you spend on drinking a healing potion determines the result.

- Action: heal the max amount (as if every die rolled its maximum)
- Bonus Action: roll for the amount as usual

# Hack off a limb

You can try to severe a creature's limb by declaring this before your attack roll.
You gain disadvantage for your roll. If you hit the creature, it takes no damage but loses the limb and drops all items that limb was holding.
Limbs can only be severed in one round if their thickness is less than the average person's neck.
Spells without an attack roll cannot be used.

# Critical hits

Critical hits don't deal double dice damage. Instead they do the regular dice max damage + the regular attacks damage (dice + modifiers).

Example: a 2d6+2 attack crit becomes 12+2d6+2 damage.

# Skill checks during combat

Once per turn, a player may ask for a skill check to do *something*. This can be anything, as long as they can make it plausible. The monsters can do this too, the extent of it depending on their level of intelligence.

Example: Athletics check to trip a foe.

# HP gain when leveling up

If you roll a hit die to determine your HP increase, reroll ones.
