# Preface

All of these house rules are at the DM's discretion and may be adjusted to fit the situation.


# Healing Potions

The amount of "time" you spend on drinking a healing potion determines the result.

- Action: heal the max amount (as if every die rolled its maximum)
- Bonus Action: roll for the amount as usual


# Hack off a limb

You can try to severe a creature's limb by declaring this before your attack roll.
You gain disadvantage for your roll. If you hit the creature, it takes no damage but loses the limb and drops all items that limb was holding.
Limbs can only be severed in one round if their thickness is less than the average person's neck.
Spells without an attack roll cannot be used.


# Critical hits

## Perkins Crit

Critical hits don't deal double dice damage. Instead they do normal attack's max damage + the regular attacks damage (dice + modifiers).

Example: a 2d6+2 attack crit becomes 12+2d6+2 damage.

## Inspirational Crit 

When a player scores a crit, another player character who witnessed the crit gains inspiration.


# Martial classes

Something to consider to give martial classes more options than "I make a bonk" every round.

## Skill checks during combat

Once per turn, a player may ask for a skill check to do *something*. This can be anything, as long as they can make it plausible. The monsters can do this too, the extent of it depending on their level of intelligence.

Example: Athletics check to trip a foe.

## Battle maneuvers (research needed) 

Any martial class gains a superiority die and battle maneuvers. 
Battle Master fighters get a buff to theirs.


# HP gain when leveling up

If you roll a hit die to determine your HP increase, reroll ones.


# Degrees of Success and Failure on ability checks

There are multiple DCs for checks that make the binary outcome of a traditional check into a staircase. e.g. DC 15 to climb a wall uses double movement. Success by 5+ uses no extra movement. Fail by less than 5 and you can't climb it. Fail by 5+ and you fall prone - but no damage.

IMPORTANT: the punishment for a fail by 5 must always be equal or lesser than the reward for a success by 5 to incentivise players' creativity.


# Grappling as an opportunity attack

The target makes a save against `8 + proficiency + STR`.


# Exhaustion

## Levels of exhaustion 

Every level of exhaustion adds a -1 modifier to:

- attack rolls 
- ability checks
- saving throws 

Death saving throws are unaffected.

## Death from exhaustion

At 11 levels of exhaustion your character dies.

## Gaining and losing exhaustion

Dropping to 0 HP adds a level of exhaustion. A long rest removes 1 level of exhaustion. A **comfortable** long rest removes 2-3 levels of exhaustion (at DM's discretion). 

### Pushing your limits 

When your resources are sparse, your character can push its limits in desperation to gain something in exchange for exhaustion. 

Examples:

- drink a healing potion at 0 HP in exchange for 5 levels of exhaustion (truly a last resort)
- gain advantage on a check for 1 exhaustion 
- gain a spell slot for 2 exhaustion per slot level


# Helping

If you are proficient in the check that is being attempted, you can always help without any justification.

If you are not proficient, you must describe how you are helping or roleplay it and the DM will decide whether to grant the advantage on the roll.


# Feat at level 1

Must not be a stat increase.


# 0 HP

When your character is at 0 HP, they are in the "Dying" state. It's like the traditional "Unconscious" state with these additions:

- you can crawl 1 space per turn
- you cannot stand up

## Flashbacks

Every time a character makes a death saving throw, they recount one significant scene from their past life that is flashing before their eyes to make their death (or near-death) more impactful.
